## Description

### Project Motivation & Purpose

I was motivated to work on this project, because I wanted a quick & simple way to create a logos using SVG shapes. This will eliminate future costs associated with hiring a graphic designer when I don't need a fancy logo. Additionally, this will allow me to add a finishing touch onto future projects to put my distinct logo on future projects.

### What I Learned Making This Project

I learned how to integrate inquirer data and class constructors to generate an SVG image. I learned how to use class constructors. Additionally, I clarified what an npm is and how to install libraries through the terminal. I also learned how to create a package.json file using npm init. I learned how to create a shape using SVG. I learned how to generate different shapes and customize the size and fill. I also learned how to insert text inside of an SVG shape.

## Installation

You will need to install inquirer and jest through the terminal for this code to be functional on your computer. You can do so by utilizing 'npm init' using the package.json file included in this repository.

## Usage

You can use this code to generate a simple SVG logo. In order to do so, you must clone this repository to your local machine, and then navigate to the file in your terminal. Once you have done this, you will type 'node index.js' into the terminal and click enter. You will be prompted to answer several questions that will influence the design of your logo. Once you have answered all the questions, the code will create a new 'logo.svg' file where you will be able to open and view your finished design in the browser.

## Tests

Testing is an important part of ensure every project runs successfully and meet standards of our acceptance criteria for any project we complete for our user. Please see below for more information (if applicable) about the tests used for this project:

This project includes tests that ensure that for each potential shape you can rendor, the correct code is rendered to the generated logo.svg file. For this project, we created 3 tests (Circle, Triangle, and Square). If our code passes the test, then the following criteria will be met:

Circle: render a green circle
Triangle: render a blue triangle
Square: render a red square

A demonstration of the test running is included in the Walkthrough video included in the [Usage](#usage) section of this README file.
